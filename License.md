# Main thread
I wanted to actually describe license more, because it might be a bit not clear, as in the "About NativePython" file.

# List of topics
1. What is an open source license
2. Why I choose open source
3. My own strictions

# What is an open source license

An open source license is a type of license, which says, that any person can edit your project and publish your mofified version.
Actually, when you won't choose any license for your project, anybody who edits it, will be automatically the author of the main project.

# Why I choose open source

Basically I choose open source, because with this license, all of you can modify NativePython! I would want to see, how you could 
extend my whole project. So if you want not only use NativePython, you can open the file and type some new, cool stuff.
Then, you can share it with the community of NativePython, but, there are some stricts from me, so before you'll share your work, please,
read this documentation to the end.

#My own strictions

Actually, I do make only one striction - credits of modified project. As you might understood, open source license gives you possibility
of modifying my project and sharing your work. But, I want to be sure, that you will include me as a base author of the package.
So please, be sure to include me as a part of full credits.

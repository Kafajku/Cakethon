# Cakethon's license

Cakethon's license is just as simple, as it could ever be, in this case, I call it: **JFPU License 1.0**

# Cakethon's JFPU License 1.0

What does actually JFPU means? Simply: **Just For Private Use**.
So the full name is - **Just For Private Use License 1.0**.
This license means, that user can use Cakethon just for private needs.
The full rights of user are written in the next topic.

What about using my license? If you want to have same rights, as I have (with **JFPU License 1.0**), simply, copy all text from this file, changing *Cakethon* namespace to some other ("User cannot use same namespace for his project on GitHub (Cakethon)."). Also

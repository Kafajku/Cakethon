# Cakethon's license

Cakethon's license is just as simple, as it could ever be, in this case, I call it: **JFPU License 1.0**

# Cakethon's JFPU License 1.0

What does actually JFPU means? Simply: **Just For Private Use**. So the full name is - **Just For Private Use License 1.0**.
This license simply implies, that user can do everything he want, but for private use. So, you can e.g. modify Cakethon a little bit,
but keep it private. What user (for example) cannot do, is shown in the list of "Stricts of the license" section.

# Stricts of the license

In here, you can see, what for example you cannot do with the Cakethon, which is automatically implied with the JFPU License 1.0.

## The list with (example) stricts

- User cannot make profit directly of Cakethon.
- User cannot modify Cakethon and publish modified version.
- User cannot share project as his own creation.
- User cannot use same namespace for his project on GitHub (Cakethon).
- User cannot claim rights for Cakethon.
- User cannot distribute Cakethon as "second author".
